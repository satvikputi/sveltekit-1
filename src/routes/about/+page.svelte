		<b>Rules of the Game:</b>
Rock Paper Scissors is typically played with two participants. The players simultaneously chant "Rock, Paper, Scissors" and then make a hand gesture representing one of the three options: rock, paper, or scissors.

		<b>Rock:</b> Form a fist with your hand.
		<b>Paper:</b> Extend your hand flat, with fingers together.
		<b>Scissors:</b> Extend your hand, separating your index and middle fingers to resemble a pair of scissors.
The outcome of each round is determined by the following rules:

<b>Rock beats scissors: The rock smashes the scissors.
Scissors beats paper: The scissors cut the paper.
Paper beats rock: The paper covers the rock.
If both players make the same gesture, it results in a tie, and the game is usually replayed until a winner is determined. The game continues with multiple rounds until one player reaches a previously agreed-upon number of wins or until a specific objective is achieved.

Rock Paper Scissors is a game that relies on chance, psychology, and quick decision-making. It has become a popular pastime and has even been studied in the context of game theory and human psychology.
